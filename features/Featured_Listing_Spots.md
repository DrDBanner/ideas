# Particl Market Featured Listings

## Summary 
An auction-style Particl market feature rewarding the highest bidders with "featured listing" spots for X amount of time. Community can vote on the amount of time a winner gets to keep a given featured listing spot through self-governance voting.

If the community votes for 1 week, then a spot winner would get to own the specific featured spot he bid on for a period of 1 week. A new bidding round starts as soon as the previous round ends, lasting until the previous featured listing spot timer ends.

Winners earn their spot as soon as a bidding round ends. A user can own multiple featured spots and can also win them even if they owned the spot of the previous bidding round.

Losers have their bids refunded, minus a small fee paid in PARTs to prevent spamming and bloating of the network.

There is a minimum bidding price to avoid people plastering products in categories where there were no bids. The minimum bidding price can be either voted through self-governance or hard-coded, just like listing fees. This can be seen as some sort of product spamming safeguard feature. 

All bidding fees are redirected to stakers. To make it fairer to the community of stakers, it could maybe be possible to divide the winning bids by the amount of blocks between the beginning and end of the subsequent bidding rounds. This would make staking rewards more equal and benefit all stakers rather than only one lucky staker getting a ridiculously huge staking reward. 

## Probability of real word usage -and why
* Vendors are always looking for ways to promote their products. This is an almost mandatory feature for some.
* Most marketplaces offer centralized solutions, most of the time they are targetted to a specific demographics.

## Economic assessment
* Vendors want ways to promote their products, which in turn brings them more sales. It is highly probable that the right product featured in the right category would bring vendors more profits than the cost of their bids.
* This feature will drive a bigger number of vendors to Particl 
* All bidding fees are redirected to stakers, which will make staking much more profitable. This will in turn encourage more people to start running staking nodes, thus securing the network.


## Pro Arguments -global
* More vendors because of the presence of this almost mandatory feature to any marketplace
* Bigger stakes, possibly increasing the total of staking nodes due to an heightened financial incentive

## Con arguments -global
* Featured listings are not targetted to specific demographics/user buying and browsing history
* Can be visually "in the way" if a user doesn't care about any of the featured listings (annoying)
* The more money you are ready to invest, the more likely you are to win spots. Gives an advantage to people with more money, but is the free market at play.
